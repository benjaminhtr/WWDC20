  ## About the playground
  The idea behind this playground is to help people who are experiencing problems with writing. This mainly concerns children in primary school or people like my father. He, like many others, suffers from multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease. Above all he has immense difficulties with writing. In order to help him and many others, I've chosen Machine Learning, since it's the only way to make computers our assistants. I'm sure you've heard of it before, but don't worry if you haven't. On the [next page](@next), Iâ€™ll tell you more about it.
